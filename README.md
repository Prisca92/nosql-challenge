# nosql-challenge

In this nosql-Challenge I was given the task by the editors of a food magazine, Eat Safe, Love, to evaluate some of the ratings data in order to help their journalists and food critics decide where to focus future articles. First I set up my database and Jupyter Noteook by Importing the data provided in the establishments.json file from my Terminal. I also needed to ensure that I created and uploaded the database properly. I then update the database and made some changes. Finally I was able to conduct some exploratory analysis where I was able help them find the locations they wish to visit and avoid by answering the following questions through exploring the database using $regx as part of my search, compared geocode to find the nearest locations,as well as using the aggregations method to answer one of my questions.
